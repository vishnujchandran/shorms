# Next Session: Shorms - Future Enhancements

We have successfully completed the initial roadmap (Phases 1-6).
The application is now a fully functional multi-page form builder with advanced validation, JSON import/export, and code generation.

## Potential Future Steps

1.  **More Field Types:**

    - File Upload (requires handling in `FormRunner` and code gen).
    - OTP Input.
    - Phone Number Input.

2.  **Server Integrations:**

    - Generate Server Actions for form submission.
    - Database integration templates.

3.  **UI/UX Improvements:**

    - Drag-and-drop pages reordering.
    - Undo/Redo functionality.
    - Theme customization for the generated form.

4.  **Testing:**
    - Add unit tests for the complex validation logic.
    - Add E2E tests for the builder workflow.
