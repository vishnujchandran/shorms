# Next Session: Shorms - Future Enhancements

The initial Shorms roadmap (Phases 1-6) has been completed successfully.
The application is now a fully functional multi-page form builder with
advanced validation, JSON import/export, and code generation.

Database and sharing features have been removed to focus on local-first
development.

## Recent Updates (Session: Dec 15, 2025 - Refinement)

### Core Improvements
- **Field ID System**: Replaced Math.random() with nanoid for collision-resistant unique IDs
- **Enhanced Validation**:

  - Min/max value validation for number fields (NUMBER_INPUT, SLIDER)
  - File size validation for FILE_UPLOAD fields (in MB)
  - Improved validation UI in field editor
- **Example Forms**: Created 3 comprehensive sample forms in `/examples`:
  - contact-form.json - Single-page contact form
  - user-registration.json - Multi-page registration wizard
  - feedback-survey.json - Customer feedback survey
- **LLM Integration**: Created comprehensive documentation (LLM_INTEGRATION.md)

## Suggestions for Next Session

Based on current state and common form builder features:

### High Priority

- **Form Templates**: Pre-built templates for common use cases

### Medium Priority
- **Field Validation Preview**: Show validation errors in builder preview
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Speed up common operations
- **Export Options**: CSV, PDF form preview
- **Cross-field Validation**: Validate relationships between fields

### Low Priority / Nice to Have
- **Theme Customization**: Custom colors for generated forms
- **Additional Field Types**: OTP, Phone, Multi-select, Rich text
