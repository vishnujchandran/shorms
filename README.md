<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://forms.ouassim.tech)

Creating forms has never been simpler, thanks to [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) and [React Hook Form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/). But what if we took it a step further? Imagine if you could simply select the input fields you need, and the rest was done for you—automatically:

- Generate a Zod schema tailored to your selected fields.
- Create complete form code, fully integrated with your chosen fields.
- Include validation, default values, and more advanced configurations.

With just a few clicks, your form could be ready to go!
